## Description
This project analyzes the SAT performance of New York City (NYC) public high schools. The SAT is a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States, comprising three sections: reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points (total of 2400). The analysis provided in this Python project helps various stakeholders understand the performance landscape of schools in NYC.

Note: In March 2016, the SAT underwent a massive redesign, part of which included a change to its scoring system: it shifted from a 2400-point scale to a 1600-point scale.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is `schools.csv`, which contains information on various high schools in NYC, including their average scores in reading, math, and writing sections of the SAT.

## Analysis
The project answers three key questions:
1. Which schools have the best performance in math?
2. What are the top 10 schools based on total SAT score?
3. In Manhattan, how many schools are there, and what is the average and standard deviation of their total SAT scores?

The analysis is performed using Python and the Pandas library for data manipulation.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python and Pandas installed.


## Usage
To analyze the data, follow these steps:
1. Read the data from `schools.csv`.
2. Execute the provided Python code to filter and sort the data.
3. View the results for the best math schools, top 10 schools, and SAT score statistics for Manhattan.

The scripts provided in this project include functions and analysis that can be easily modified to answer additional questions about the dataset.

## Highlights
- Identify which schools excel in math.
- Determine the overall top-performing schools in terms of SAT scores.
- Analyze SAT performance variability within the Manhattan borough.

## Credits
This project was done as part of the DataCamp's Data Scientist in Python track
