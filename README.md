# NYC Public School SAT Performance Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes the SAT performance of New York City (NYC) public high schools. The SAT is a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States, comprising three sections: reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. The analysis provided in this Python project helps various stakeholders understand the performance landscape of schools in NYC.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is `schools.csv`, which contains information on various high schools in NYC, including their average scores in reading, math, and writing sections of the SAT.

## Analysis
The project answers three key questions:
1. Which schools have the best performance in math?
2. What are the top 10 schools based on total SAT score?
3. In Manhattan, how many schools are there, and what is the average and standard deviation of their total SAT scores?

The analysis is performed using Python and the Pandas library for data manipulation.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python and Pandas installed. You can install Pandas using pip:
